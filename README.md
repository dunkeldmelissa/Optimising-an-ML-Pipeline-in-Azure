# Optimising-an-ML-Pipeline-in-Azure
This is first of the three projects required for fullfilment of the Nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure from Udacity. In this project, we build and optimise an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.

## Summary


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.

What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?

What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?

## AutoML
In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.

## Pipeline comparison
Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?

## Future work
What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?
